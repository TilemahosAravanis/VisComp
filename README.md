## Description
This project is a tool for comparing design mockups with their implemented websites. It uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition), image similarity comparison, and NLP (Natural Language Processing) to identify and list differences between the design and the implementation.

The project is written in Python and JavaScript, and uses npm and pip as package managers.

## Usage
1. Place the design mockup and the implemented website screenshot in the `Figmas_and_Web_pages/UI_test/public/images` directory. The design mockup should be named `Figma_design.png` and the implemented website screenshot should be named `Web_page.png`.
2. Run the `Main.py` script:
    ```bash
    python Main.py
    ```
3. The script will analyze the images and output a list of differences in the `differences.txt` file in the same directory as the images.

4. Run the `server.js` script to start the server:
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
5. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:{PORT}` to view the differences between the images. (In `{PORT}` enter the port number that the server is running on. In current script the port is set to '**8000**')

## Project Structure
The project consists of several Python scripts and a JavaScript file:

- `Main.py`: The main script that orchestrates the comparison process.
- `Image_Similarity.py`: Contains the function for computing the cosine similarity between two images.
- `Claude_3_Sonnet.py`: Contains the function for finding differences between two images using NLP.
- `Object_det.py`: Contains the function for object detection in images.
- `OCR.py`: Contains functions for analyzing images using OCR and comparing the results.
- `server.js`: A simple Node.js server for displaying the differences between the images in a web browser.
